# Classification Basics with the MNIST Dataset
In this Notebook I covered the basics of how supervised binary & multiclass classification works. I got everything I cover in this notebook from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit_learn & Tensorflow" from Aurelien Geron. I used the famous mnist dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
